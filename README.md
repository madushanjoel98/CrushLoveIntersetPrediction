# Crush Interest Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning model to predict if your crush is interested in you or not. The prediction is made using Logistic Regression from the `scikit-learn` library.

## Introduction

Have you ever wondered if your crush likes you back? This project aims to answer that question using data-driven methods. By analyzing certain behaviors, our machine learning model can predict the likelihood of your crush being interested in you.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of various behaviors that might indicate if someone has a crush on you. The features include:

- `Late_to_reply`: Whether the person is late to reply to your messages.
- `ignore_you`: Whether the person tends to ignore you.
- `smile_when_you_smile`: Whether the person smiles when you smile.
- `eye_contact_loss`: Whether the person loses eye contact with you.
- `ignore_your_speech`: Whether the person ignores what you say.
- `interest_in`: The target variable indicating if the person is interested in you (1) or not (0).

## Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/crush-interest-prediction.git
cd crush-interest-prediction
```

Install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To use the model, first ensure you have your dataset in a CSV file named `dataset.csv`. You can then run the model training and prediction script:

```bash
python predict_crush_interest.py
```

## Model Training

The model is trained using the Logistic Regression algorithm from the `scikit-learn` library. Here is a snippet of the training process:

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load and preprocess the data
df = pd.read_csv("dataset.csv")
X = df[['Late_to_reply', 'ignore_you', 'smile_when_you_smile', 'eye_contact_loss', 'ignore_your_speech']]
y = df['interest_in']

# Split the data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Scale the features
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)

# Train the model
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)

# Evaluate the model
y_pred = model.predict(X_test_scaled)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Model Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")
```

## Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy. Here is how you can see the evaluation results:

```bash
python evaluate_model.py
```

## Results

The trained Logistic Regression model achieved an accuracy of approximately 0.85 on the test set. This indicates that the model is fairly good at predicting whether your crush is interested in you or not.
